# ElectronicsShop

Hello everyone!

This is my first project created with Object Oriented Programming in Python. 

I have set up an electronics store where you can add products such as laptops and phones.
Store employees and customers are also created. Customers can purchase created products. 
Also a database has been added which is simple, I mainly meant to test this option by looking at sqlite3 documentation.

If you can help me with my project, feel free to comment or contact with me. I try to improve my programming skills.
Thank you in advance.
